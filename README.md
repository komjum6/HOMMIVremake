Extract the needed png files from the .h4r files using the Resource Editor ( https://gitlab.com/iLiVeInAbOx05/heroes-4-modding-open-source/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads ) or ask me directly on Basic Noobility's Discord server (you can find a link on his YouTube channel, let him know when the link goes dead)
